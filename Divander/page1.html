	<p>Here at Divander Studios we stand for 3 things: Community, Innovaton, and Teamwork.</p>

	<h2 class="headline">Who are we?</h2>
	<p>Hello, my name is Gwinny, 23 years young. I was born and raised in The Netherlands. Within Divander studios I fulfill the role of the Product owner and artist. After work I never stop drawing as I am a conspiring concept artist and art is something I am very passionate about. When I am not drawing I love to play video games and I enjoy spending time with my cats, Pip and Gray.<img class="aboutImg" src="img/Gwinny.png"></p>
	<p>Hey, I am Killian, 25 years of age. I work at Divander studios as a Designer, programmer and whip cracking cheerleader. Instead of mastering one skill, my focus lies on being the chameleon in the Divander Studios team. During my off time, I enjoy playing games, especially mobile games as I am travelling a lot. I also appreciate nature, so I often frequent botanic gardens and parks. Besides that I am a fervent Netflixer in the evening. “Copy pasting the colours from Gwinny”<img class="aboutImg" src="img/Killian.png"></p>
	<p>Hey, my name is Laura. I am an artist and a product designer in our lovely Divander studios team. My strength is playing around with my creativity. I enjoy drawing characters and building prototypes for physical products. Most of the time, I spend my leisure mostly by drawing with different materials (water colours, marker, pencils), going hiking and playing my favorite The legend of Zelda games over and over again.<img class="aboutImg" src="img/Laura.png"></p>
	<p>Hi! I’m Ryan. I am the lead developer for Divander Studios. At our company I am responsible for any programming projects including this webpage. As well, I admin our social media accounts. I am 19 years old, from the United States of America. When I am not hunched over staring at lines of code, I like to get away and go climbing - indoor bouldering or toprope, cook, and travel.<img class="aboutImg" src="img/Ryan.png"></p>
