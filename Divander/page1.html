	<h2 class="headline">What is Divander Studios?</h2>
	<p>Here at Divander Studios we stand for 3 things: Community, Innovaton, and Teamwork. Divander is a portmanteau of Diversity and Anders - the German word for different. As well, with Virtual Reality, the player dives in, hence our logo resembling a tunnel. The colors that make up our company are orange - for social interaction, purple - for awareness, and gray -  relaibility, neutrality, and protection. This is what we want people to feel when they think of Divander Studios and we want to show that in our products. Together, these are the aspects the come to make us Divander Studios</p>

	<p>Hello, my name is Gwinny, 23 years young. I was born and raised in The Netherlands. Within Divander studios I fulfill the role of the Product owner and artist. After work I never stop drawing as I am a conspiring concept artist and art is something I am very passionate about. When I am not drawing I love to play video games and I enjoy spending time with my cats, Pip and Gray.</p>

	<p>Hey, I am Killian, 25 years of age. I work at Divander studios as a Designer, programmer and whip cracking cheerleader. Instead of mastering one skill, my focus lies on being the chameleon in the Divander Studios team. During my off time, I enjoy playing games, especially mobile games as I am travelling a lot. I also appreciate nature, so I often frequent botanic gardens and parks. Besides that I am a fervent Netflixer in the evening.</p>

	<p>Hey, my name is Laura. I am an artist and a product designer in our lovely Divander studios team. My strength is playing around with my creativity. I enjoy drawing characters and building prototypes for physical products. Most of the time, I spend my leisure mostly by drawing with different materials (water colours, marker, pencils), going hiking and playing my favorite The legend of Zelda games over and over again.</p>

	<p>Hi! I’m Ryan. I am the lead developer for Divander Studios. At our company I am responsible for any programming projects including this webpage. As well, I admin our social media accounts. I am 19 years old, from the United States of America. When I am not hunched over staring at lines of code, I like to get away and go climbing - indoor bouldering or toprope, cook, travel, or can be found on the couch watching Formula 1.</p>

	<p>Hii. My name is Hellen, and I am an artist and designer at Divander Studios. Though my skills are not the best, I take great pride in whatever I create. When I am not busy realising the bombardment of ideas that sometimes catch even me off guard, you can find me on the couch watching movies and series, or behind my piano. If you ever need me, just look for the person wearing headphones. As I am a huge fan of music, it is very rare to find me without it.</p>

	<p>Hi, I am Aditya, an artist and designer at Divander studios. Apart from being a workaholic, I love to talk about food, psychology, New movies and video games. I love to design low-poly art and geometrical characters. I also love to read any psychological and sci-fi literature. I do have a tendency to follow tons of youTubers and then stick to one or two. Besides this, I like to go for long hikes and capturing amazing nature based views through my camera</td>
