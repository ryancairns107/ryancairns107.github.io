	<p>Memoria forest was once the epitome of a perfect fantasy. With grass as green as emerald and countless glistening streams. A real life paradise, that also just happened to carry something very special. You see, the trees in these woods were very unique in their own way. Instead of regular leaves, they grew messages. Thoughts from human beings that were now waiting on their death beds, but refused to let their last mission go uncompleted.</p>
	<p>That all changed, however, when one day a storm creeped over the hills. With winds strong enough to rip away all the notes from the trees, and throw them to unknown destination. What was left was a forest more resembling a graveyard. An empty sight, apart from that one paper that had been strong enough to withstand the force.</p>
	<p>The note carried a message of hope. One that meant a last chance to be able to save the forest for our main character Seda. But she wont be able to do this alone.</p>
	<p>Join Seda on her journey to try and save Memoria forest. Discover long forgotten memories, and meet the boy with the power to return peace and reform friendships. Will you be able to save the forest together?</p>

	<h2 class="headline">Health and Safety Disclaimer:</h2>
	<p>Please read the warnings below before using a virtual reality (VR) viewer to reduce the risk of personal injury, discomfort or property damage.</p>

<p>Not for Children Under 12 Years Old. Virtual reality using a viewer should be done under adult supervision in a safe environment, with frequent breaks taken, and is not recommended for children under the age of 12. Adults should monitor children who are using or have used a viewer for any of the symptoms described below and ensure that they follow these instructions.</p>

<p>Seizures. Some people (about 1 in 4000) may have severe dizziness, seizures, epileptic seizures or blackouts triggered by light flashes or patterns. This can occur while watching TV, playing video games or experiencing virtual reality, even in persons who have never had a blackout before or have no history of seizures or epilepsy. Such seizures are more common in children and young people under the age of 20. Anyone who has had a seizure, loss of awareness, or other symptom linked to an epileptic condition should see a doctor before using a viewer.</p>

<p>Stop Use If You Experience Adverse Health Symptoms. Using a VR viewer may lead to adverse health symptoms. Immediately discontinue use and consult a doctor if the following symptoms occur: seizures; loss of awareness; eye strain; eye or muscle twitching; involuntary movements; altered, blurred, or double vision or other visual abnormalities; dizziness; disorientation; impaired balance; impaired hand-eye coordination; excessive sweating; increased salivation; nausea; lightheadedness; discomfort or pain in the head or eyes; drowsiness; fatigue; or any symptoms similar to motion sickness.</p>

<p>Avoid Prolonged Use. Avoid prolonged use of a viewer, which can negatively impact hand-eye coordination, balance, and multi-tasking ability. Limit the time spent using a viewer and take breaks during use.</p>

<p>Consult a Doctor Before Use If You Have Pre-Existing Medical Conditions. Consult a doctor before using a viewer if you are pregnant, elderly, have pre-existing binocular vision abnormalities or psychiatric disorders, or suffer from a seizure disorder, heart condition or other serious medical condition.</p>

<p>Use Only In A Safe Environment. Always be aware of your surroundings when using a viewer and remain seated or standing still at all times. Take special care to ensure that you are not near other people, objects, stairs, balconies, windows, furniture, or other items that you can bump into or knock down when using—or immediately after using—a viewer. Do not handle sharp or otherwise dangerous objects while using a viewer. Never wear a viewer in situations that require attention, such as walking, bicycling, or driving.</p>

<p>Ease Into Use. Ease into the use of a viewer to allow your body to adjust; use for only a few minutes at a time at first, and only increase the amount of time using a viewer gradually as you grow accustomed to virtual reality. Looking around when first entering virtual reality can help you adjust to any small differences between your real-world movements and the resulting virtual reality experience.</p>

<p>Use Only When Feeling Healthy. A comfortable virtual reality experience requires an unimpaired sense of motion and balance. Do not use a viewer when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or earaches, as this can increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.</p>

<p>Do Not Use in Moving Vehicles. Do not use a viewer while in a moving vehicle such as a car, bus, or train, as this can increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.</p>

<p>Monitor Sound Levels. Listening to sound at high volumes can cause irreparable damage to your hearing. Background noise, as well as continued exposure to high volume levels, can make sounds seem quieter than they actually are. Due to the immersive nature of the virtual reality experience, do not use a viewer with the sound at a high volume so that you can maintain awareness of your surroundings and reduce the risk of hearing damage.</p>
