  <p>For young children, Halloween night is one of the best of the year. But trick-or-treating can be dangerous if kids and parents aren't careful. Take a look at some vital trick-or-treating tips before you accompany your child.</p>
  <p class="hideLink" style="color:black; font-size:.5em">FINAL ANSWER = 'haunted house'</p>
  <h2 style="margin-top:-5px">1. Plan a route in advance.</h2>
  <p>Trick-or-treating could take you several streets away from your house, which can cause sore legs and a bit of frustration. Avoid long paths by mapping out a route before leaving the house. Stick to paths that you and your child are familiar with to avoid getting lost.</p>

  <h2>2. Wear comfy shoes.</h2>
  <p>Make sure you and your children are in comfortable, well-fitting shoes. Girls in dresses should avoid <abbr title="FINAL HINT = HIGHLIGHT">heels</abbr>, and all shoelaces should be double-tied to avoid tripping in the dark.</p>

  <h2>3. Stay well-lit.</h2>
  <p>Apply reflective tape to your child's costume to ensure they are seen by drivers on the road. Also, carry a flashlight with you to keep your child's path lit at all times.</p>
  <h2>4. Make sure all costumes are short.</h2>
  <p>Long costumes that drag on the ground can be dangerous, especially at night. After purchasing your child's costume, make sure it's an appropriate length, and hem anything that's too long to avoid tripping.</p>
  <h2>5. Avoid masks.</h2>
  <p>Masks can make it difficult for your child to see or breathe. If possible, skip the mask altogether and use non-toxic make-up to complete the costume instead.</p>

  <h2>6. Use flexible props.</h2>
  <p>Try to avoid costumes that have weapons as accessories. But if your child's costume won't be complete without a weapon, make sure it is rubber or plastic. Choose a prop that won't cause injury to your child or their friends.</p>
  <h2>7. Check your child's candy.</h2>
  <p>When sorting through candy at the end of the night, be sure to throw away any candy that is not in its original wrapper, or looks as though it has been opened.</p>
