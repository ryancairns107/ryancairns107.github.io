<h2 style="margin-top: 75px">Celebration Madness</h2>
<p>Sure, most countries celebrate New Year’s Eve with the occasional firework, but make no mistake: this ain’t your pretty little light show put on by the local municipality! No, no my friends, this Dutch tradition could more so be described as COMPLETE-AND-UTTER-EXPLODING -CHAOS!</p>
<p>Dutchies young and old take to the streets, the parks, the public squares – essentially everywhere and anywhere – and literally start blowing shit UP! The first words that will come to most expats/tourists/foreigners lips when describing the evening of the 31st is “war zone”, and in fact, it’s not too far from the truth. The Dutch sky starts to light up as soon as the sky goes dark, and the clangs and bangs don’t stop until the wee wee hours of the morning.</p>
<p>Is it not dangerous, you ask? Why, yes it is. Last year, the Dutch government reported that over 700 people were injured: 5 hands amputated, several fingers removed, 236 eye injuries (91 of them with permanent damage) and 23 cases of blindness. 190 ambulances, 270 police cars, and 233 firetrucks were dispatched. So, yes, there is indeed a lot of action on this night!</p>
<p>It seems however, that the Dutchies are divided on this issue. In a recent survey, 50% of Dutch people would like to see more restrictions on the festivities, whereas the other 50% are staunch defenders of this beloved “Dutch tradition”.</p>
