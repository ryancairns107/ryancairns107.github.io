<p>
St. Nicholas' Eve is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on 5 December, the night before Saint Nicholas Day in the Northern Netherlands and on the morning of 6 December, Saint Nicholas Day itself, in the (Roman Catholic) southern provinces, Belgium, Luxembourg and Northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine and Artois). He is also well known in territories of the former Dutch Empire, including Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and Suriname. Sinterklaas is the primary source of the popular Christmas icon of Santa Claus. The holiday spirit begins in mid-november when Sinterklaas and his helper (Zwarte Piete) sail to the Netherlands from Spain. Following this, Christmas is also celebrated nation-wide in the Netherlands and Sinterklaas is not a replacement.</p>
<h2>Based off Sinterklaas:</h2>
<p>Germany and Austria (Sankt Nikolaus); Hungary (Mikulás); Switzerland (Samichlaus); Italy (San Nicola in Bari, South Tyrol, Alpine municipalities, and many others); parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia (Sveti Nikola); Slovenia (Sveti Nikolaj or Sveti Miklavž); Greece (Hagios Nikolaos); Romania (Moș Nicolae); Albania ("Shën Kolli" (Nikolli), among others, are all based off of the Dutch Sinterklaas character. </p>
<h2>Character:</h2>
<p>Sinterklaas is an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or chasuble over a traditional white bishop's alb and sometimes red stola, dons a red mitre and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured crosier, a long ceremonial shepherd's staff with a fancy curled top. He traditionally rides a white horse. In the Netherlands, the horse is called Amerigo, and in Belgium, it is named Slecht Weer Vandaag, meaning "Bad Weather Today". Sinterklaas carries a big, red book, called The Book of Sinterklaas, in which is written whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year. Sinterklaas is followed by his helper, Zwarte Piete</p>
<h2>Gift Giving:</h2>
<p>Back in more modest times, presents consisted of mandarin oranges, chocolate letters (the initial of your first name), chocolate coins or marzipan figures. Nowadays, full fledged gift giving is in effect with the average Dutch home spending upwards of 130 EUR on presents.</p>
