<p>Zwarte Piete (translation: Black Pete) is Sinterklaas' companion in dutch folklore. Zwarte Piete is depicted in black face (discussed later)</p>
<p>You know it’s that time of the year again in Holland, when you are greeted by some Dutch person on the street, whose face is painted completely black and is sporting an afro wig, bright red lips and a ridiculous clown-like costume.  What is possibly more strange than this very sight, is the fact that many Dutch person finds it a completely normal and acceptable occurrence.  Yes, most Dutch people love their Zwarte Piets (Black Peter’s)!
Throughout November and early December the beloved Zwarte Piet icon is ubiquitous and can be found manically smiling away at every turn (grocery store flyers, posters, window displays, television commercials, wrapping paper, candy, and so on). The painted black face image is inescapable.</p>
<h2>Folklore and Controversy:</h2>
<p>Many western foreigners living or visiting Holland are horrified by  images of Zwarte Piete. Why? Because they naturally conjure up the images of American Blackface: a theatrical practice of the 19th century which propagated racist stereotypes and the mockery of African slaves, and which, appropriately ceased to exist once the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s came into play. Thus the existence of a modern-day nationally-beloved Blackface icon can be associated and/or confused with the racist stereotypes and degrading propaganda of yesteryear.</p>
<p>Some people name the reason that Zwarte Piete's face is <i>zwarte</i> is because of soot from a chimney, but in reality, Zwarte Piete was simply a slave in original folklore.</p>
<p>The folklore states that if a child is misbehaved, Zwarte Piete will put them in his sac, bring them back to spain, and beat them.</p>
<p>Regardless of the explanation, Zwarte Piet’s very presence annually ignites a heated debate amongst Dutch people, tourists, expats and the immigration communities of Holland. Is Zwarte Piet a harmless childhood tradition not worth debating? Or is it an archaic offensive character that no longer has a place in a multicultural society? We’ll keep our opinions to ourselves, but it’s up to YOU to decide!</p>
