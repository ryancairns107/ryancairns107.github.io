<h2 style="margin-top: 75px">Stammpot:</h2>
<p>A traditional Dutch winter dish, Stamppot is a mish-mash of potatoes and vegetables like spinach, carrot, boerenkool (cabbage)  and onions. Translated as “stamped pot” or “mash pot”, the dish is sometimes served along with pieces of meat.</p>
<h2>Erwtensoep:</h2>
<p>One of the most popular dishes during the cold season, Erwtensoep (“pea soup”) is prepared from green split peas made into a thick stew with celery, onions, and potatoes. The soup is often served with rye bread. In case you do not wish to make it at home, you can buy a can of Erwtensoep from the supermarkets. The soup is also available at the small road-side food stalls during the winter season and is relished by locals and visitors alike.</p>
<h2>Stroopwafels:</h2>
<p>Thin crispy wafers filled in with a warm sweet syrup, Stroopwafels (“Syrup wafers”) are one of my personal favourites during the Winters. If you walk along the busy streets and market areas in the Netherlands, you will easily notice stands serving Stroopwafels and several other Dutch delicacies.</p>
<h2>Oliebollen:</h2>
<p>Claimed often as a not-so-healthy snack, Oliebollen (“oil balls”) are pleasantly delectable. They consist of small donut balls made by mixing flour, yeast, eggs, and milk. Visit any of the small eateries for delicious Olieballen coated with powdered sugar.</p>
<h2>Pepernoten:</h2>
<p>Pepernoten are a kind of cookie-like dessert, traditionally associated with the Sinterklaas holiday.  They are light brown, randomly shaped, and made from flour, sugar, aniseed, cinnamon, and cloves.  They tend to be fairly chewy, although if they are left out uncovered they will harden up a bit. According to Wikipedia, “a particularly distinct custom associated with pepernoten is throwing them in handfuls through the room so children can look for them. Originally this is an ancient fertility symbol (like a farmer sowing seeds) not unlike throwing rice at a marriage.”</p>
<h2>Kruidnoten:</h2>
<p>Kruidnoten on the other hand are harder, have a slightly different colour and are more round and uniform in shape.  They are also associated with the Sinterklaas period.  If you are familiar with speculaas, then you will recognize kruidnoten as they are made with mainly the same ingredients. An exciting trend has taken off in relation to kruidnoten as they can now be found with all sorts of coverings.  Everything from chocolate covered kruidnoten to caramel kruidnoten can be found.</p>
